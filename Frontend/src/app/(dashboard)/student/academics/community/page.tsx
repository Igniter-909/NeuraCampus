  Data Fetching and Structure for Chat Application

  1. **Data Fetching**:
     - You can fetch the community and chat data from the backend using a REST API.
     - Use the following route to get the data:
       - **GET /api/community**: This endpoint should return the community data, including user information, community details, and chat messages.

  2. **Expected Data Format**:
     - The response from the backend should be in JSON format and structured as follows:
     ```json
     {
       "user": {
         "id": "u1",
         "name": "Alex Morgan",
         "avatar": "https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=32",
         "status": "online",
         "role": "Student",
         "year": "3rd Year",
         "department": "Computer Science"
       },
       "categories": [
         {
           "name": "Academic Communities",
           "communities": [
             {
               "id": 1,
               "name": "Computer Science Hub",
               "description": "Discussion forum for CS students",
               "lastMessage": "Anyone up for the coding challenge?",
               "time": "04:15 am",
               "avatar": "https://picsum.photos/200/200?random=1",
               "unreadCount": 3,
               "isActive": true,
               "members": {
                 "total": 156,
                 "online": 23
               },
               "admins": ["Dr. Smith", "Prof. Johnson"],
               "tags": ["Programming", "Algorithms", "Development"]
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "generalChats": [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "sender": "Leslie Alexander",
           "message": "Has anyone started working on the assignment yet?",
           "time": "10:15 pm",
           "avatar": "https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=33",
           "role": "Student",
           "isOwn": false,
           "reactions": ["üëç", "ü§î"],
           "reactionCount": 2
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

  3. **Chat Application Access**:
     - Users can access the chat application to communicate with their peers regarding academic topics, group projects, and other community-related discussions.
     - Recruiters can also use this chat application to contact students. When a recruiter wants to reach out, they can initiate a chat through the application, which will be visible in the general chat section.
     - The application should allow recruiters to send messages directly to students or create group chats for discussions.

  4. **Schema Overview**:
     - **User**: Represents the individual using the chat application.
     - **Community**: Represents a group of users discussing specific topics.
     - **Chat Message**: Represents individual messages exchanged between users.
     - **Recruiter Interaction**: Recruiters can send messages to users, which will appear in the chat interface, allowing for seamless communication.

  Ensure that the backend is set up to handle these requests and that the data is structured as specified for the frontend to function correctly.
